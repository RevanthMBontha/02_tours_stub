# 02_tours_stub

Part of a larger set of small React web apps to practice creating Custom Components

This stub is a component that displays the list of tours of a mock tour company. The data is fetched from an external API which I created using netlify. This component has the ability to remove each tour and once all the tours are removed, a Refresh button is shown to fetch tours again.
